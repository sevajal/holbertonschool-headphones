In this project, I will implement from scratch, without any library, a web page. I will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that I learned previously.

I wonâ€™t have a lot of instruction, I am free to implement it the way that I want - the objective is simple: Have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the designer file.

Requirements:

    I am not allowed to import external CSS framework (like Bootstrap)
    I am not to use Javascript
    The web page must switch to the mobile version when the screen width is 480px or less
    Links hover/active: #FF6565
    Button hover/active: opacity: 0.9
    Max width of the content: 1000px centered in the page
